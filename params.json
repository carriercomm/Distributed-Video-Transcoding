There are different open source video transcoding and processing tools freely available in Linux, like libav-tools, ffmpeg, mencoder, and handbrake. However, none of these tools support **PARALLEL** computing easily.\r\n\r\nAfter some research, I found amazing [solution](http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2014/07/scalable-parallel-video-transcoding-on.html) designed & developed by '[Dustin Kirkland](http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2014/07/scalable-parallel-video-transcoding-on.html)' based on Ubuntu JUJU and [avconv](https://libav.org/avconv.html). But our requirement was little bit diffrent from Dustins's solution. Our requirement was to convert single video in Multi-bitrate and in formats like 3gp, flv. Also we want to build this solution on top of CentOS and ffmpeg. So I decided to design and develop \"Simple Scalable, Parallel, Multi-bitrate Video Transcoding System\" by myself. Here is my solution.\r\n\r\nThe Algorithm is same as Dustin's solution but with some changes:\r\n\r\n  1. Upload file to FTP. After a successful upload CallUploadScript(pure-ftpd function) will call script:\r\n      - Script is responsible for syncing files to all nodes(Disabled ssh encryptions to speed up transfer)\r\n      - Updating duration, file path, filename of video and number of nodes available currently for transcoding to MYSQL\r\n  2. Transcode Nodes will split the work into even sized chunks for each node\r\n  3. Each Node will then process their segments of video and raise a flag when done\r\n  4. Master node will wait for each of the all-done flags, and then any master will pick the job to concatenate the result\r\n  5. Upload converted files to different CDN\r\n\r\nPre-requisites:\r\n  1. bc\r\n  2. nproc\r\n  3. ffmpeg\r\n  4. mysql\r\n  5. mysql-server(For master node)\r\n  6. mplayer\r\n  7. rsync\r\n  8. Password less ssh login\r\n  9. nfs server and client\r\n  10. screen\r\n  11. ffprobe\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
